# shdevkit

This is a portable dev kit full of bash scripts I use everyday to manage my developer workflow, featuring ArchLinux, Neovim and Sway.

**Yes. I used bash arrays.**

## Installation and usage

### Requirements

The following packages are required to use the scripts:

- `git`
- `sway`
- `fzf`

Should work both with `bash` and `zsh`. Just source the aliases and add the folder to the PATH to have everything executable.
Remember to give permissions to the scripts.
